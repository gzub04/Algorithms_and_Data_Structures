# EADS
Project created for **Algorithms &amp; Data Structures** classes at Warsaw University of Technology.  
Most noteworthy is task 3 with AVL tree
## Lab 1
**Create a Sequence class with template <typename Key, Typename Info> with the following methods:**
- shallow and deep copy
- operator=
- merging of two sequences
- insert at end
- print sequence
- reset sequence

## Lab 2
**Create a Ring buffer with template <typename Key, Typename Info> with the following methods:**
- addNode
- iterator class inside of Ring class, that will have the following
  - getKey, getInfo
  - iterator++, ++iterator
  - iterator-- and --iterator

## Lab 3
**Create an AVL tree dictionary with template <typename Key, Typename Info> with the following methods:**
- insert new entry
- remove entry
- search and display entry
- print whole tree
- show all in order
